# DN3.0_Exercises


I am Sagnik Sanyal. My Superset ID: 5007097. 


I am a student of MCKV Institute of Engineering, pursuing B.TECH in Electronics and Communication Engineering, 4th year.

I uploaded the "Week_1_Exercises" & "Week_2_Exercises" folder's Zipped edition to this repository. This folder contains all my coding files and word analysis theory file.

GitHub was not permitting to upload each folders separately as it contains more than 100 files. So I uploaded the folder in zipped format. Please unzip it and then evaluate for my performance.
 
Thank you and extremely sorry for the inconvenience.
